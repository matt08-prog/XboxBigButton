Then your ButtonStateChanged event handler will receive a callback every time the user presses a button on any of the controllers attached.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the included example App project for more usage examples.\r\n\r\n# Further info\r\n[My blog](http://hardkjarni.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/how-to-use-xbox-360-big-button.html) goes into some details about the process of getting the custom driver to work.\r\n","google":"UA-69499318-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
